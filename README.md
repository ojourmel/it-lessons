###Lesson Plan

Each lesson consists of three parts:
1. Theory and reading material
2. Practical lab
3. Evaluation

####Theory
This section contains introduce the topic of the lesson, and includes some background on the topic. A reading list is also provided. This often contains links to Wikipedia articles.  It is important to recognize the wiki articles contain more information that is necessary, and quickly scanning the headers of a wiki article can be used to gain a fast, general understanding of a topic.

The Theory section also contains other resources that may be useful in the Practical lab, and the Evaluation, including previous lesson topics that will be required.

####Practical
This section of the lesson contains a task, or set of task, which should be completed. Each lab attempts to utilize the Theory of a topic, while providing a hard example of the lesson topic.

####Evaluation
In order to know that the concepts of the lesson have been learned, this section contains several short questions and answers for the topic. Questions will cover both the theoretical and the practical aspects of the lesson.

###Lesson difficultly

The difficulty of each lesson will vary, however, in general lessons will be small, and not too challenging. As more and more foundational material is covered, lessons topics will become more complex, and will pull on previous lesson topics.

###Lesson length

While the length of a lesson is dependent on it's particular topic, lessons are broken down into no more than 1 hour sessions. The reading material may exceed that time limit, however the lab exercise *is* limited to a short time period. Lessons should be able to be completed once per week, with anywhere from 30 minutes, to 5 hours worth of reading, lab, and questions.

####Additional Notes

This is very much a work in progress, and additional material will be added as time goes on. Feel free to use the [Issue](https://github.com/ojourmel/it-lessons/issues) tracker to suggest additional topics of interest, or questions regarding the lessons. Note that a GitHub account will be required to comment on issues.

Although it is not strictly necessary, it is recommend to complete lessons sequentially, as they will expand on previous topics.

As a final note, this [git](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_%28software%29) repository will undergo some changes as this project is expanded, and the organization of each lesson may change.
